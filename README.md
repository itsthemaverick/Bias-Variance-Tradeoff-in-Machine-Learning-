# Bias-Variance-Tradeoff-in-Machine-Learning-
This repository demonstrates one of the most fundamental challenges in Machine Learning — the Bias–Variance Tradeoff.  Instead of relying on definitions alone, this project builds models of increasing complexity, shows where and why they fail, and then applies regularization and cross-validation to systematically fix those failures.
